# JVM vs JDK vs JRE

### JVM

- It is a package that contains development tools to run our Java programs
- It contains JRE to execute our program.

### JDK

- It is a runtime environment that run our Java programs.

### JRE

- It acts as a runtime engine to run our Java program.
- JVM is responsible for executing Java programs line by line, hence it is also known as an interpreter.

# Conditionals

### 1. if-else

```
if (num1 % 2 == 0) {
    System.out.println("Even");
    }
else {
    System.out.println("Odd");
}
```

### 1. Switch, break, continue

```
switch (o) {
            case '+':
                System.out.println(num1 + num2);
                break;
            case '-':
                System.out.println(num1 - num2);
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println(num1 * num2);
        }
```

# Loops

### 1. For Loop

```
for(int i=0; i<=5; i++){
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

### 2. While Loop

```
while (true){
    System.out.println("Infinite Loop");
}
```

### 3. Do-while Loop

```
do {
    System.out.println("Infinite Loop");
}
while (true)
```
